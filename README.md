Betch is a simple, responsive theme for Hugo with a focus on writing. This is a modification of the [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch) theme with some very minor improvements.

The current state of the documentation is horrible. I haven't used Hugo for a long time and these code has been written a long time a go. Eventually documentation will be added and improved. In the mean time, **I strongly advise against using this theme**.
